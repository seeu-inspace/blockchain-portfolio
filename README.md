## Introduction

The **Blockchain** is a set of technologies in which the ledger is structured as a chain of blocks containing transactions and consensus distributed on all nodes of the network. All nodes can participate in the validation process of transactions to be included in the ledger.

There are two common types of operations that are carried out to create a cryptocurrency:
- **Mining (Proof-of-Work)** Validation of transactions through the resolution of mathematical problems by miners who use hardware and software dedicated to these operations. Whoever solves the problem first wins the right to add a new block of transactions and a reward;
- **Staking (Proof-of-Staking)** consists of users who lock their tokens in a node called a validator. The validators take turns checking the transactions on the network. If they perform well, they receive a prize distributed among all the participants of the validator, otherwise, they receive a penalty.

**Ethereum** is a blockchain that has popularized an incredible innovation: smart contracts, which are a program or collection of code and data that reside and function in a specific address on the network. Thanks to this factor, it is defined as a "programmable blockchain".

Note: By design, smart contracts are immutable.  This means that once a Smart Contract is deployed, it cannot be modified, with the exception of the [Proxy Upgrade Pattern](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies).

A token can be created with a smart contract. Most of them reside in the ERC20 category, which is fungible tokens. Other tokens are ERC-721 and ERC-1155, aka NFTs.

A **decentralized application**, also known as **DApp**, differs from other applications in that, instead of relying on a server, it uses blockchain technology. To fully interact with a DApp you need a wallet.
DApps are developed both with a user-friendly interface, such as a web, mobile or even desktop app, and with a smart contract on the blockchain. 

The fact that there is a user-friendly interface means that the "old vulnerabilities" can still be found. An example: If a DApp has a web interface, maybe an [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) on it can be found and exploited. Another evergreen is phishing, that is frequently used to steal tokens and NFTs.

The source code of the Smart Contracts is often written in **Solidity**, an object-oriented programming language. Another widely used programming language, but less than Solidity, is **Vyper** (Python).

Most of the time the smart contract code is found public in a github such as `github.com/org/project/contracts/*.sol` or you can get it from Etherscan, for example by going to the contract address (such as that of the DAI token), in the Contract tab you will find the code https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#code and contract ABI > a json which indicates how the functions of the smart contract are called.
In any case, the source is almost always public. If it's not public, you can use an EVM bytecode decompiler such as https://etherscan.io/bytecode-decompiler, just enter the contract address here.

#### Web3 glossary

- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** A blockchain-based organization that is structured by self-enforcing smart contracts and democratically run by its users using open-source code. A vote is taken by network stakeholders on every decision.

- **Liquidity** The capacity to swap an asset without significantly changing its price and the simplicity with which an asset may be turned into cash are both examples of liquidity.

- **Oracle** A blockchain protocol receives external real-world data from Oracles, third-party information service providers. This implies that they can increase the security, veracity, and strength of the data that a blockchain network receives and make use of.

#### Ethereum glossary

- **application binary interface (ABI)** The standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interactions.

- **bytecode** An abstract instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter or a virtual machine. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecode is expressed in numeric format.

- **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)** A design document providing information to the Ethereum community, describing a proposed new feature or its processes or environment.

- **Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC)** A label given to some EIPs that attempt to define a specific standard of Ethereum usage.

- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** is a complex, dedicated software virtual stack that executes contract bytecode and is integrated into each entire Ethereum node. Simply said, EVM is a software framework that allows developers to construct Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps).

- **hard fork** A permanent divergence in the blockchain; also known as a hard-forking change. One commonly occurs when nonupgraded nodes can't validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules. Not to be confused with a fork, soft fork, software fork, or Git fork.

- **wei** The smallest denomination of ether. 10<sup>18</sup> wei = 1 ether.

#### Personal security

- Store your assets in a **cold wallet** (hardware wallet) instead of a hot wallet (Centralized exchanges or CEXs). Some good examples are [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/);
- Keep your **seedphrase** in a safe place and don't share it with anyone. If possible, use a solution like [Zeus from Cryptotag](https://cryptotag.io/products/zeus-starter-kit/);
- Use 2FA, use a password manager (like [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)), double check links and be aware of phishing, read [Five OpSec Best Practices to Live By](https://www.threatstack.com/blog/five-opsec-best-practices-to-live-by).

  web3.js is very useful for interacting with a smart contract and its APIs. Install it by using the command `npm install web3`. To use it in Node.js and interact with a contract, use the following commands:
  ```javascript
   1: node;
   2: const Web3 = require('web3');
   3: const URL = "http://localhost:8545"; //This is the URL where the contract is deployed, insert the url from Ganache
   4: const web3 = new Web3(URL);
   5: accounts = web3.eth.getAccounts();
   6: var account;
   7: accounts.then((v) => {(this.account = v[1])});
   8: const address = "<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>"; //Copy and paste the Contract Address
   9: const abi = "<ABI>"; //Copy and paste the ABI of the Smart Contract
  10: const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address).
  ```
- [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/)
  ethers is a JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. It provides a simple, lightweight interface for making calls to smart contracts, sending transactions, and listening for events on the Ethereum network. Install it with the command `npm install ethers`. An example is [_ethers.js](JavaScript/_ethers.js)
